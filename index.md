<h2 align="center">Welcome!</h2>

This wiki details the ins and outs of the [Figura Rewrite](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-The-Moon/FiguraRewriteRewrite).

{: .note }
> This wiki is not affiliated with Moonlight nor the developers behind it. I am just a community member who noticed the lack of a wiki and made one.

This wiki is constantly updated, so please contact me if there is an issue concerning the wiki through my DMs (@Slyme#2894 on Discord, @Slyme on Revolt) or the [issues page](https://github.com/Slymeball/Figura-Wiki/issues).

{: .warning }
> So, I kinda lied when I made the statement of "constantly updated." Turns out, burning yourself out is quick and easy, and I haven't felt the want to work on this much more.
> 
> If you want a more up-to-date wiki, check out [KitCat962's Wiki](https://github.com/KitCat962/FiguraRewriteRewrite/wiki), which has the intention of being the official wiki and is currently being used as the Wiki link in-game.
> 
> I'd also like to mention [Limit System's Figura Docs](https://limitsfiguradocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which has more effective tutorials on things that matter (model parts, action wheels, etc.)

## What is Figura?

Figura is a Minecraft Mod dedicated to reworking the Minecraft skin system, allowing users to change their player model, animate it, and manage it through Lua scripts all without ever needing a server-sided mod.
