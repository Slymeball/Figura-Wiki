## Unofficial Links

> :warning: **Warning**  
> Being unofficial means that these sites, series, etc. are not moderated in any way by the Moonlight development team, and are created by people outside of it. **DO NOT** ask official staff about any of the following resources. 

- Slyme's Figura FAQ (you are here): <https://github.com/Slymeball/figura-faq/wiki>
- applejuice's Figura Rewrite Docs: <https://applejuiceyy.github.io/figs>
    - Although this resource is unofficial, it *does* use the documentation from in-game.
- Chloe's Rewrite Tutorial: <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNz7v2g2SFA8lOQUDS4z4-gIDLi_dWAhl>
    - Okay, technically this is created by the admin of the Moonlight Discord server, but it is still unofficial in the same way that a patch to a program issued by a single Microsoft developer wouldn't be considered something endorsed by Microsoft.
